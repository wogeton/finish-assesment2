    <div class="about">
        <p >Every day, hundreds of species face the threat of extinction due to deforestation, illegal trafficking, poaching, and climate change. From the majestic Bengal tigers to the sea turtles that roam our oceans, each of these creatures plays a vital role in the balance of ecosystems. Their disappearance will not only affect biodiversity but will also have a direct impact on our own lives and those of future generations.

            But there is still hope. We know that when humanity unites with a purpose, we can achieve great changes. Thanks to the efforts of biologists, conservationists, and committed volunteers, we have managed to save species that were once on the brink of extinction. However, our work is far from over.</p>
